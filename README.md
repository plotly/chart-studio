# chart-studio
The chart-studio Python package contains utilities for interfacing with Plotly's Chart Studio service (both Chart Studio cloud and Chart Studio On-Prem).

Prior to plotly.py version 4, these Chart Studio utilities were included in the `plotly` package under the `plotly.plotly` module. As part of plotly.py version 4, the Chart Studio functionality was removed from the `plotly` package and released in this `chart-studio` package.

This repository contains _only_ the chart-studio Python package; code for the Chart Studio service itself is located elsewhere.

_Note: chart-studio was previously housed in the [Plotly.py](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py) repository [until early 2025](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/4972). This repository retains the Git history for all chart-studio files, dating back to [mid-2019](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1604) when the Plotly.py directory structure was changed. If you want to follow the history of these files back further in time, start [here](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/commits/59e36cf850bdb2384ddaf40ac37ad79f691c610c/chart-studio-package/README.md?browsing_rename_history=true&new_path=packages/python/chart-studio/README.md&original_branch=master)._
